NAME

Win32::RASE - managing dialup entries and network connections on Win32


ABSTRACT

This module implements the client part of Win32 RAS API.

It is named RASE(RAS-entry) because it was originally designed to
create/delete/change/manage RAS/DUN entries. Now it implements
synchronous dialing, hang up and the wide range of RAS/DUN entry
manipulations.

The current version of Win32::RASE is available at:

  http://www.dux.ru/guest/fno/perl/

See RASE.pm for full POD documentation.


INSTALLATION

As this is just a plain module no special installation is needed.
Put it into the Win32 subdirectory somewhere in your @INC.

Anyway the usual sequence
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

should do. In addition

make html

will convert POD documentation to HTML file.

("make" here means probably "nmake" or "dmake" or "pmake" - whatever
make-program you use).


This module needs Windows Remote Access Service (RAS) or
DialUp Networking (DUN) to be properly installed including
dialing properties.

rasapi32.dll, tapi32.dll

Win32::API module by Aldo Calpini.

enum.pm (1.014 or later, no compilations) by Byron Brummer (aka Zenin)

Time::HiRes (0.18 or later) by Douglas E. Wegscheid makes work more precise.



CAVEATS

This module has been created and tested in a Win95 environment.
Although I expect it to function correctly on any version
of Windows NT, that fact has been confirmed for NT 4.0 build 1381 only.

Some of the RAS APIs were not included in the RasAPI32.dll that was shipped
with the old releases of Windows 95. To use the RAS APIs mentioned here,
you need to install the at least Dial Up Networking (DUN) 1.2b upgrade.
This upgrade is available for download on:

http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/contents/Updates/W95DialUpNetw/default.asp

This upgrade was incorporated in Win95 OSR.

From the MS KB# Q157765: Early releases of Windows 95 may require
an additional RNAPH.DLL that contains some of new phonebook manipulation APIs.
There currently is no workaround for this situation in this version of the module.

Some APIs may also not work properly on WinNT with old Service Packs.
Make sure that you are using the last Service Pack available.
List of Bugs Fixed in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 1, 2, and 3 is
available at

What can we do here, guys? That's how it goes...
